# Learn Calculus with Claude

Interactive Jupyter notebooks to help beginners learn calculus, step by step.

## Overview

This project provides an interactive approach to learning differential calculus through Jupyter notebooks. Each lesson builds on previous concepts and includes:

- Theory explanations with LaTeX math formulas
- Interactive visualizations
- Python code to explore mathematical concepts
- Exercises to test your understanding

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- Jupyter Notebook/Lab
- Required Python packages listed in `pyproject.toml`

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/learn_calculus_with_claude.git
   cd learn_calculus_with_claude
   ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install the dependencies using UV (or pip):
   ```bash
   uv pip install -e .
   ```
   
   Or with pip:
   ```bash
   pip install -e .
   ```

4. Launch Jupyter Lab:
   ```bash
   jupyter lab
   ```

5. Navigate to the `notebooks` directory and start with `lesson1_introduction.ipynb`

## Lesson Structure

1. **Introduction to Calculus** - Basic concepts and functions
2. **Limits** - Understanding and calculating limits
3. **Derivatives: Introduction** - Core concepts of derivatives
4. **Derivatives: Clarified** - Deeper insights into derivatives
