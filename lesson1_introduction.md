# Introduction to Calculus

Welcome to your journey into calculus! This course is designed for beginners, and we'll build your understanding step by step.

## What is Calculus?

Calculus is a branch of mathematics that studies continuous change. It has two main branches:

- **Differential calculus**: focuses on rates of change and slopes of curves
- **Integral calculus**: focuses on accumulation of quantities and areas under curves

This course will start with differential calculus.

## Why Learn Calculus?

Calculus is essential for:

- Physics and engineering
- Economics and finance
- Computer science (especially machine learning)
- Understanding natural phenomena

## Exercise 1: Understanding the Concept of a Function

Before diving into calculus, let's review functions.

A function relates an input to exactly one output. We often write functions in the form f(x) = [some expression with x].

**Task**: For each of the following, determine if it's a valid function and explain why:

1. f(x) = x²
2. g(x) = √x
3. h(x) = 1/x
4. The relationship between a person's name and their age
5. The relationship between a temperature in Celsius and Fahrenheit

Please write your answers below, explaining your reasoning for each.

After completing this exercise, we'll assess your understanding and move to the next lesson

1. yes valid, x to the power of 2
2. valid, square root of x
3. valid, we divide 1 / x but careful, x shouldn't be 0
4. I'm don't think there's a way to map one to the other, no relationship, therefore no valid function.
5. valid, given a temp in celcius, we can calculate it in fahrenheit, so there' s a clear function there
