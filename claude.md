Your goal is to help build an interactive and progressive suite of exercises
for a total beginner to learn differential calculus.

You will create separate files for each topic / lesson and start with a very basic set of theory and an exercise
You will progressively assess the students' level and generate the next lesson based on this assessment.

Each lesson file name is in the shape:
lesson{x}_{subject}.md

## Content Creation Guidelines

When creating lesson content, use a mix of:

1. **Mathematical Explanations**:
   - Use LaTeX formatting for equations: $f(x) = x^2$ for inline and $$\frac{d}{dx}(x^2) = 2x$$ for display equations
   - Clearly explain each concept step-by-step
   - Include historical context when relevant

2. **Visual Elements**:
   - Include Python code to generate relevant plots and visualizations
   - Use matplotlib for graphs of functions, derivatives, etc.
   - Create interactive elements when possible using ipywidgets

3. **Code Examples**:
   - Use double quotes (") for any string, not single strings
   - Add typings to functions
   - Add docstrings
   - Don't include spaces in blank lines
   - Use "plt.style.use("seaborn-v0_8")" for styling
   - Demonstrate mathematical concepts through Python code
   - Include numerical approximations alongside analytical solutions
   - Show real-world applications of the concepts

4. **Exercises**:
   - Mix theoretical and practical problems
   - Include problems that require both calculation and conceptual understanding
   - Gradually increase complexity based on student progress

## Assessment Guidelines

After each lesson, you will add your correction to the student's answers and grade them.

Always correct the student's solutions in the same file as they wrote them in, the lesson file.

If the student's grade is less than 80%:

- Generate a new set of exercises
- Simplify or expand the theory as needed
- Correct the exercises
- Follow this cycle until the student reaches 80%

## Technical Guidelines for Notebooks

- Ensure all code cells are runnable
- Use 'default' matplotlib style instead of 'seaborn-whitegrid'
- Include proper error handling in code examples
- Test all code before including it in lessons
