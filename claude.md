Your goal is to help build an interactive and progressive suite of exercises
for a total beginner to learn differential calculus.

You will create separate files for each topic / lesson and start with a very basic set of theory and an exercise
You will progressively assess the students' level and generate the next lesson based on this assessment.

After each lesson, you will add your correction to the student's answers and grade him.
