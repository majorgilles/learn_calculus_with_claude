    "Let me explain this in simpler terms:\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine a curved road. If you're standing at a specific point on this road and want to know how steep it is exactly where you're standing, that's what we're trying to find with a derivative.\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem is that to measure steepness, we typically need two points to draw a line between them. But we only want the steepness at one exact point.\n",
    "\n",
    "So here's what we do:\n",
    "1. We pick a second point very close to where we're standing\n",
    "2. We measure the steepness between these two points\n",
    "3. We move the second point closer and closer to our position\n",
    "4. As the second point gets extremely close to where we're standing, the measured steepness gets closer and closer to the exact steepness at our single point\n",
    "\n",
    "That final steepness (when the points are infinitely close together) is the derivative."
