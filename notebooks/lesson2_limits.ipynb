    "## What is a Limit?\n",
    "\n",
    "A limit describes the value a function approaches as the input approaches a particular value. We write:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\lim_{x \\to a} f(x) = L$$\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "For most well-behaved functions, finding a limit is straightforward:\n",
    "1. Take the value that x is approaching (let's call it a)\n",
    "2. Plug this value directly into the function f(x)\n",

    "1. $\\lim_{x \\to 3} (x^2 - 4)$\n",
    "   You're on the right track, but there's a small error. It should be $3^2$ (3 squared), not $3^3$ (3 cubed).\n",
    "   Correct solution: $3^2 - 4 = 9 - 4 = 5$ âœ“\n",
    "\n",
    "2. $\\lim_{x \\to 1} \\frac{x^3 - 1}{x - 1}$\n",
    "   You correctly identified that direct substitution gives $\\frac{0}{0}$!\n",
    "   To solve this indeterminate form, we can factor the numerator:\n",
    "   $x^3 - 1 = (x - 1)(x^2 + x + 1)$\n",
    "   So our limit becomes:\n",
    "   $\\lim_{x \\to 1} \\frac{(x - 1)(x^2 + x + 1)}{x - 1} = \\lim_{x \\to 1} (x^2 + x + 1) = 1^2 + 1 + 1 = 3$\n",
    "\n",
    "3. $\\lim_{x \\to 0} \\frac{x + 2}{x^2 + 4}$\n",
    "   Your setup is correct, but there's an error in the calculation.\n",
    "   Direct substitution gives: $\\frac{0 + 2}{0^2 + 4} = \\frac{2}{4} = \\frac{1}{2}$\n",
    "\n",
    "4. $\\lim_{x \\to 2} \\frac{|x - 2|}{x - 2}$\n",
    "   This is trickier! We need to evaluate from both sides:\n",
    "   - When x < 2: $|x - 2| = -(x - 2)$, so the expression equals -1\n",
    "   - When x > 2: $|x - 2| = (x - 2)$, so the expression equals 1\n",
    "   Since these values differ, the limit does not exist.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. $\\lim_{x \\to 0} \\frac{\\sin(x)}{x}$\n",
    "   You're right that direct substitution gives $\\frac{0}{0}$, but this is a special limit that equals 1.\n",
    "   We can verify by calculating values near x = 0:\n",
    "   - When x = 0.1, $\\frac{\\sin(0.1)}{0.1} \\approx 0.998$\n",
