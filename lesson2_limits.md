# Limits: The Foundation of Calculus

Great work on understanding functions! Now we'll explore limits, which form the foundation of calculus.

## What is a Limit?

A limit describes the value a function approaches as the input approaches a particular value. We write:

lim(x→a) f(x) = L

This means: "as x gets closer and closer to a, the function f(x) gets closer and closer to L."

## Why Limits Matter

Limits allow us to:
- Define derivatives (which we'll explore soon)
- Analyze function behavior at points where the function isn't defined
- Understand continuity of functions

## Examples of Limits

1. lim(x→2) x² = 4
   As x gets closer to 2, x² gets closer to 4.

2. lim(x→0) (sin x)/x = 1
   This is a special limit we'll explore later.

## Evaluating Simple Limits

To find most limits, you can directly substitute the value:
lim(x→a) f(x) = f(a) if f is continuous at a.

## Exercise 2: Finding Limits

For each function, find the limit (if it exists):

1. lim(x→3) (x² - 4)
2. lim(x→1) (x³ - 1)/(x - 1)
3. lim(x→0) (x + 2)/(x² + 4)
4. lim(x→2) |x - 2|/(x - 2)
5. lim(x→0) sin(x)/x

For any challenging ones, try making a table of values as x approaches the target value from both sides.

After completing these problems, we'll assess your understanding of limits and move to the next concept.
