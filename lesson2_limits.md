# Limits: The Foundation of Calculus

Great work on understanding functions! Now we'll explore limits, which form the foundation of calculus.

## What is a Limit?

A limit describes the value a function approaches as the input approaches a particular value. We write:

lim(x→a) f(x) = L

This means: "as x gets closer and closer to a, the function f(x) gets closer and closer to L."

## Why Limits Matter

Limits allow us to:
- Define derivatives (which we'll explore soon)
- Analyze function behavior at points where the function isn't defined
- Understand continuity of functions

## Understanding Limits Simply

When we write lim(x→a) f(x) = L, we're asking:
"What value does f(x) get very close to when x gets very close to a?"

### The Direct Substitution Method

For most well-behaved functions, finding a limit is straightforward:
1. Take the value that x is approaching (let's call it a)
2. Plug this value directly into the function f(x)
3. The result is your limit

This works because many functions are "continuous" - which just means there are no sudden jumps, gaps, or breaks in their graphs.

### Example with Numbers

Consider f(x) = x² and we want lim(x→3) x²

If we use direct substitution:
- Plug in x = 3 into x²
- Get 3² = 9
- Therefore, lim(x→3) x² = 9

You can verify this by calculating values very close to 3:
- When x = 2.9, f(x) = 8.41
- When x = 2.99, f(x) = 8.94
- When x = 2.999, f(x) = 8.994
- When x = 3.001, f(x) = 9.006
- When x = 3.01, f(x) = 9.06
- When x = 3.1, f(x) = 9.61

Notice how the function values get closer and closer to 9 as x gets closer to 3.

### When Direct Substitution Doesn't Work

Direct substitution doesn't work when:
1. Plugging in the value gives 0/0, ∞/∞, or other undefined results
2. The function has a discontinuity (jump or gap) at that point

For these cases, we need other techniques like factoring, rationalizing, or approaching from both sides.

## More Examples of Limits

1. lim(x→2) x² = 4
   As x gets closer to 2, x² gets closer to 4.

2. lim(x→0) (sin x)/x = 1
   This is a special limit we'll explore later.

## Exercise 2: Finding Limits

For each function, find the limit (if it exists):

1. lim(x→3) (x² - 4)
2. lim(x→1) (x³ - 1)/(x - 1)
3. lim(x→0) (x + 2)/(x² + 4)
4. lim(x→2) |x - 2|/(x - 2)
5. lim(x→0) sin(x)/x

For any challenging ones, try making a table of values as x approaches the target value from both sides.
